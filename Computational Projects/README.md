### Galaxy Collision Project

- make a simulation of a galaxy inside an nfw dark matter halo
- evolve the galaxy in time (using leapfrog integration)
- ensure it's stable under its own gravity and the kinetic & potential energies are making sense, then do something really wacky
- simulate a minor merger by having a really heavy particle pass by the galaxy
- watch the galaxies collide and never recover
